# ls
The ls command is used to list files or directories in Linux (or other Unix-based operating systems).
Just like you navigate in your File explorer or Finder, the ls command allows you to list all files or directories in the current directory by default.

The ls command also accepts flags/options which are additional information that changes how files or directories are listed.
